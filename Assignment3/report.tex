\section{A hotel reservation server}

The help message is implemented at client side, as server should not prescribe the user interface that must be used to provide the hotel reservation services to the users. In this way, different types or versions of clients can be supported. The client is responsible to provide an user interface to call the right methods at the server by RMI.
